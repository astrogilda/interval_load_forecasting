## TimeSeriesLoader

This class provides a straightforward way to load the target variable and weather data from CSV files. It ensures that the file exists before loading and properly formats the index as a datetime type.

## TimeSeriesEDA

This class provides methods for plotting the raw time series data and performing seasonal decomposition. This allows for visual inspection of underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality.

## TimeSeriesPreprocessor

The TimeSeriesPreprocessor class handles common preprocessing tasks in time series forecasting. These tasks include handling duplicates, aligning timestamps, filling missing indices, and handling missing and infinite values.

## TimeSeriesFeaturizer

This class provides methods for feature engineering specific to time series data. It includes functionality to create calendar features, such as month, day, and time of day, and to find optimal lags using PACF. These features are essential for capturing the temporal dependencies and patterns in time series forecasting.

## TimeSeriesXy

The TimeSeriesXy class provides functionality to create future features for time series regression. It takes into account target variables and forecast horizons, allowing for flexibility in modeling different prediction tasks.

## TimeSeriesTrainer

The TimeSeriesTrainer class provides a comprehensive solution for time series regression, including model training, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and logging. It supports different cross-validation strategies and integrates with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization and MLflow for experiment tracking.

## TimeSeriesSimulator

This class provides functionality to simulate a production-like environment for time series forecasting. It includes methods to perform forecasting using a trained model and manage the test data and predictions.

## Future Work

The code requires several enhancements for production deployment:

* Logging and Monitoring: Replace print statements with proper logging to monitor model performance and errors.
* Scalability: Optimize code for parallel processing or distributed computing to handle large datasets.
* Configuration Management: Implement a configuration file to manage hyperparameters, paths, and other settings.
* Data Validation: Implement robust data validation to handle changes in data format or quality.
* Error Handling: Improve error handling to gracefully manage unexpected scenarios.
* Model Versioning: Integrate model versioning to manage different versions of trained models.
* Deployment Strategy: Plan for cloud deployment, considering aspects like security, scalability, and cost.
* Continuous Training: Implement continuous training to update the model as new data arrives, ensuring relevance.
* API Development: Develop APIs to allow other systems to consume the forecasts.
* Testing: Enhance test coverage, including unit and integration tests, to ensure code reliability.
* Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for maintainability and collaboration.





1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.1 Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the foundational step that provides insights into the underlying structure of the data.
